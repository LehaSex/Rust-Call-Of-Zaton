## Overview
Welcome to "RUST : Call Of Zaton" a custom map for the game RUST that immerses players in a post-apocalyptic world where survival is a luxury. This expansive map, with a size of 4000, boasts around 40,000 prefabs, creating a rich and detailed environment. The map shows the location "Zaton", which resembles the location of the same name from the game Stalker Call of Pripyat, but adapted to the rast and made so as not to violate copyright.

The layout includes evenly spaced and optimized monuments to reduce the FPS load for customers and ensure a smooth gameplay. The design of the terrain includes many different places where players can have fun.

For those who are looking for a strategic advantage, there are enough free places on the map to control the area.

A traveler can discover a large number of small halts and detached buildings that are not marked on the road map, which conceal caches of useful resources. Adventurers can visit many monuments similar to the locations from the original game but in the RUST setting. Dangerous locations, hostile mobs, puzzles and radiation will make the gameplay really interesting.

"RUST : Call Of Zaton" is not just a map; it's a lot of work and 2 months of summer invested in it to work out every aspect in detail"
